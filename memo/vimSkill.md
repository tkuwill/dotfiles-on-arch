## Useful vim skills

1. buffers
    - bd : Close the buffer you are in currently. Remove it from the buffers list.a
    - bn : Go to the **next** buffer.
    - bp : Go to the **previous** buffer.
2. Paste words from system's clipboard: Use `"+p` in **normal mode**. (In archlinux, you should install `gvim` package to have the clipboard feature.) Lowercase `p` pasting the word after the curosr. Uppercase `P` pasting the word before the cursor.
3. Copy words to system's clipboard: Use `"+y` in **visual mode**.
4. In **normal mode**, `0` or `^` means `home` . (But they are a little different.)
5. In **normal mode**, `$` means `end`. (`g_` is also `end` but it is a little different from `$`.)
