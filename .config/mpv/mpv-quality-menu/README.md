# quality-menu
A userscript for MPV that allows you to change the streamed video and audio quality (ytdl-format) on the fly.

Simply open the video or audio menu, select your prefered format and confirm your choice. The keybindings for opening the menus are configured in input.conf, and everthing else is configured in quality-menu.conf.

## Features

- Currently playing format is marked and selected when opening the menu
- Remembers selected format for every url in the current session (e.g. going back to previous playlist item automatically selects the prefered format)
- Controllable entirely by mouse or keyboard (opening by mouse requires either the OSC extension, [uosc](https://github.com/tomasklaen/uosc) or an additional entry in [`input.conf`](https://mpv.io/manual/stable/#input-conf))
- All format related information from yt-dlp/youtube-dl can be shown
- Columns that are identical for all formats are automatically hidden
- Formats can be sorted based on resolution, fps, bitrate, etc.
- Simple reload functionality
- Columns and their order are configurable
- **(optional)** Graphical menu via [uosc](https://github.com/tomasklaen/uosc) integration  
    Note: Requires uosc 4.0.0 or newer.

## OSC extension
**(optional)** An extended version of the OSC is available that includes a button to display the quality menu.

**PLEASE NOTE:** This conflicts with other scripts that modify the OSC. Merging this OSC modification others is certainly possible. Depending on how the osc is modified, the [osc.patch](osc.patch) might apply cleanly, but you have to make sure the filename in the patch lines up with the filename of your files.

## Installation
1. Save the `quality-menu.lua` into your [scripts directory](https://mpv.io/manual/stable/#script-location)
2. Set key bindings in [`input.conf`](https://mpv.io/manual/stable/#input-conf)
    ```
    F     script-binding quality_menu/video_formats_toggle
    Alt+f script-binding quality_menu/audio_formats_toggle
    ```
    **(optional)** `Ctrl+r script-binding quality_menu/reload`

3. **(optional)** Save the `quality-menu.conf` into your `script-opts` directory (next to the [scripts directory](https://mpv.io/manual/stable/#script-location), create if it doesn't exist)
4. **(optional)** UI integration (pick one)
    - For OSC: Save the `quality-menu-osc.lua` into your [scripts directory](https://mpv.io/manual/stable/#script-location)  and put `osc=no` in your [mpv.conf](https://mpv.io/manual/stable/#location-and-syntax)
    - For [uosc](https://github.com/tomasklaen/uosc) (each is optional)
        1. Add the video and audio menu to the uosc menu by appending `#! ...` to your key bindings in [`input.conf`](https://mpv.io/manual/stable/#input-conf)
        ```
        F     script-binding quality_menu/video_formats_toggle #! Stream Quality > Video
        Alt+f script-binding quality_menu/audio_formats_toggle #! Stream Quality > Audio
        ```
        2. Add buttons to the `contols=` option in your [`uosc.conf`](https://github.com/tomasklaen/uosc/blob/main/script-opts/uosc.conf)
            1. `<!has_many_video,video,stream>command:theaters:script-binding quality_menu/video_formats_toggle#@vformats>1?Video`
            2. `<!has_many_audio,has_audio,stream>command:graphic_eq:script-binding quality_menu/audio_formats_toggle#@aformats>1?Audio`

## API
This was originally made for the [uosc](https://github.com/tomasklaen/uosc) integration.
The way it is integrated has changed since then, but I wanted to make the API available regardless.
It has been made a bit more general since the uosc integration with little testing, so consider this experimental.
If you notice any problems, please open an issue about it.

Receiving the following script messages is suppored, with the parameters in braces.

- `video-formats-get` `(url, script_name)`  
    Request to send the available formats for `url` to `script_name` with the `video-formats` script message.  
    If there are currently no formats available, the request is queued up and the formats are send out as soon as they are available.
- `audio-formats-get` `(url, script_name)`  
    Analogous to `video-formats-get`.
- `video-format-set` `(url, format_id)`  
    Set the `format_id` for the given `url`. Setting this to `nil` disables the video format.
    If `url` is the currently playing video, it will set `ytdl-format` and reload the video.
    This does not check if the id is actually available, so it is possible to set invalid ids. But that means it is also possible to set something like `bestvideo[height<=1080]`.
- `audio-format-set` `(url, format_id)`  
    Analogous to `audio-formats-get`.
- `register-ui` `(script_name)`  
    Whenever the menu would get toggled, it instead sends a script message to `script_name`.  
    For the video menu it sends the `video-formats-menu` message, and for audio it sends the `audio-formats-menu` message.

The following script messages are send out on request or after registering.

- `video-formats` `(url, formats, format_id)`  
    Sends the available `formats` and current `format_id` for url to the script that requested it via `video-formats-get`.  
    `formats` is a JSON array that contains all available video formats.  
    ```
    formats = Format[]
    
    Format {
        label: string
        format: string
    }
    ```
    - `label` is the line that quality-menu would display for that format.
    - `format` is the format id for that format.
    
    The JSON array can be converted into a Lua table using `formats = utils.parse_json(formats)`
- `audio-formats` `(url, formats, format_id)`  
    Analogous to `video-formats`.
- `video-formats-menu` `()`  
    Callback for toggling the video menu.
- `audio-formats-menu` `()`  
    Analogous to `video-formats-menu`.


## Plans For Future Enhancement
- [x] Visual indication of what the current quality level is
- [x] Option to populate the quality list automatically with the exact formats available for a given video
- [x] Optional OSC extension
- [x] [uosc](https://github.com/tomasklaen/uosc) integration
- [ ] *\[your suggestion here\]*

## Credit
- [reload.lua](https://github.com/4e6/mpv-reload/), for the function to reload a video while preserving the playlist.
- [mpv-playlistmanager](https://github.com/jonniek/mpv-playlistmanager), for the menu formatting config.
- ytdl_hook.lua, much of the  code to fetch the format list with youtube-dl came from there.
- somebody on /mpv/ for the idea
