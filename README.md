- This is my dwm dotfiles used on my **ASUS Zenbook 14 UX425JA**. 
- Also, it is more like a *litte memo* for what I have installed rather than a install guideline.
- For the sake of longer battery runtime, I have **few configs** for beauty only.
- All things here all have their duty to be here. (In my opinion.)
- I would also provide a viewpoint for those who don't know what to install after a fresh install of **archlinux**.
- I *might forget* listing something that has to be installed first before using my dotfiles, so if you want to use these, check first!
- If you also have some questions like above, maybe it is good for you to have a look!
